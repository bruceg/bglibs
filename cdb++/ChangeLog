	* cdb_reader.cc: Converted to using fdbuf routines.

	* cdb_get.cc: Converted to using fdbuf routines.

1999-03-19  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* internal.h: Renamed cdb_internal.h to this.

1999-03-18  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* cdb_internal.h: Moved several internal functions into here
	instead of in the main header file; fixed some signed char
	conversion bugs.

	* cdb_get.cc (seek): Typo: & should have been *.
	(seek): Don't reassign value of "pos" until after its used to set
	lenhash.

1999-03-16  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* cdb_writer.cc (abort): Protect the close and unlink calls
	against repeated or extraneous calls, to prevent unlinking an
	existing temporary file.

	* cdb_writer.cc: These routines now call the new C++ cdbmake
	routines.

	* cdb_make.cc: Copied the contents of cdb-0.55/cdbmake_*.c into
	here and converted into C++ style code.

1999-03-15  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* cdb_getrec.cc (cdb_getrec): Simply call cdb_reader::get in this
	function.

	* cdb_get.cc (get): Moved all of cdb_getrec into cdb_reader::get
	and cdb_reader::seek, and optimized it for multiple reads (only
	read the header once and store it).
