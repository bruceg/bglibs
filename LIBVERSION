1:2:0

Notes from libtool's info pages:

libtool library versions are described by three integers:

CURRENT
     The most recent interface number that this library implements.

REVISION
     The implementation number of the CURRENT interface.

AGE
     The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that this
     library implements.  In other words, the library implements all the
     interface numbers in the range from number `CURRENT - AGE' to
     `CURRENT'.

   If two libraries have identical CURRENT and AGE numbers, then the
dynamic linker chooses the library with the greater REVISION number.

  1. Start with version information of `0:0:0' for each libtool library.

  2. Update the version information only immediately before a public
     release of your software.  More frequent updates are unnecessary,
     and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger
     faster.

  3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last
     update, then increment REVISION (`C:R:A' becomes `C:r+1:A').

  4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
     last update, increment CURRENT, and set REVISION to 0.

  5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
     then increment AGE.

  6. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release,
     then set AGE to 0.
