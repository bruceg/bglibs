1999-08-15  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* mystring.h (class mystring_iter): Changed the default seperator
	for strings to '\0'
	(class mystring): Added a NUL constant (single 0 byte string).

1999-07-26  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* mystring.h (class mystring_iter): Added this new iterator class,
	taken from code used in vmailmgr.  It is used to iterate over
	essentially a token-delimited string.

1999-07-14  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* Removed all vestiges of mystringtmp support from this library.

1999-07-13  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* append.cc: Fixed same bug as below in append.

	* assign.cc: Fixed bug in assign and dup where NULL pointers
	caused a crash.

	* append.cc, assign.cc: removed the mystringtmp versions of the
	append, assign, and dup operations.  mystringtmp now only exists
	in the cons[2-7].cc files and tmp.cc

	* find.cc: Split this file into find_first, find_first_of,
	find_last, and find_last_of.

1999-07-12  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* join.cc (traverse): This routine traverses the linked list and
	builds a mystringrep out of it.

	* mystring.h: Renamed TRACE to MYSTRING_TRACE.
	Added a new mystringjoin class.  This class is used to turn a list
	of calls to "operator+" into a single constructor by building a
	linked list on the stack.  This will replace mystringtmp.

	* rep.cc (struct _rep_stats): Fixed the percentage function to not
	do divide-by-zero; modified the "slack" reporting to report a
	percentage of the requested length.

	* assign.cc: Re-added dup and assign functions for "char*" type,
	moving the constructors and assignment operators inline.

	* append.cc: Re-added append functions for "char*" type.

1999-07-08  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* mystring.h (class mystring): Eliminated the "mystring" return
	value for the assign and append operators, since this return value
	is never used and causes extra operations.

	* operator_plus.cc: Created this new file containing the
	"operator+" routine.

	* operator_pleq.cc: Created this new file containing all the
	"operator+=" routines.

	* assign.cc: Created this new file containing all the assign and
	dup primitives.

	* mystring.h (class mystring): Removed the += operator taking
	"mystringtmp" parameter, and replaced it with two routines, one
	for "const mystring&", and one for "const char*".  This results in
	a net code shrinkage.

	* rep.cc (struct _rep_stats): Added this optional statistics
	gathering class to determine the effectiveness of the slack space
	and string appending.

	* append.cc (append): Use the new rep->append routine.

	* rep.cc (alloc): Allocate an amount of "slack" space when
	allocating a string, to allow for later appends.
	(append): This new routine appends a string to the current rep if
	and only if the current rep has a single reference and the new
	length of the string will fit within the current size.  If not, it
	makes a dup of this+str and returns a pointer to it.

1999-06-07  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* tmp.cc: Removed the contents of checkstr, and moved the
	necessary parts into the constructors.  This makes the code more
	efficient, as the constructors are adequately specific to omit
	some of the branches in the comparisons.  It also ensures that len
	is always initialized, allowing many of the simple functions to be
	moved inline to the header file.

1999-04-01  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* cons7.cc (mystring): Wrote this constructor to build a string
	from 7 inputs.
