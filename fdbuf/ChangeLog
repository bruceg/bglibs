2000-04-07  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@bguenter.pointsnorth.com>

	* fdobuf_signed.cc (operator<<): Immediately output a '-' for
	negative numbers rather than storing a negative flag for later.

	* fdobuf_unsigned.cc (operator<<): Moved the integer versions of
	this operator into their own modules.

	* fdobuf_seek.cc (seek): Moved this routine out of fdobuf.cc

	* fdibuf.cc (read_large): Added this routine to read in a chunk of
	data larger than the size of the buffer.

2000-04-06  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@bguenter.pointsnorth.com>

	* fdibuf_netstring.cc (getnetstring): Moved this routine into its
	own source file.

	* fdobuf.cc (write_large): Added this routine to write out a chunk
	of data larger than the size of the buffer, to avoid doing extra
	copies.
	(write): Removed an extraneous code segment.

	* fdobuf.h: Moved the fdobuf declarations here.

	* fdibuf.h: Moved the fdibuf declarations here.

	* fdbuf.h: Removed extraneous fdobuf declaration.

1999-07-08  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdobuf.cc (write): Optimized this routine better for the case
	where the amount of data to be written will fit inside the buffer.

1999-07-05  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdbuf.h (fdobuf,fdibuf): Made some of the routines here virtual
	in order to extend it properly.
	Added "tell()" operations to both fdibuf and fdobuf to indicate
	the current logical read/write point.

1999-07-04  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdobuf_chownmod.cc: Added two new routines chown and chmod,
	which operate directly on the open fd.

1999-06-30  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdibuf_mystring.cc (getline): Make this routine return the
	number of bytes actually read, including the delimiter, even
	though the delimiter is not added to the returned string.

1999-06-29  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdibuf.cc (fdibuf): Added a 'seekfwd' function to seek forwards
	"o" bytes.

	* fdibuf_mystring.cc (getline): Added locking and set the count
	properly.

1999-06-28  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdibuf.cc (get): Make sure count is set for get.

1999-06-06  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdbuf.cc (fdbuf): Fixed long-standing bug -- I forgot to delete
	the buffer in the destructor.
	(close): Modified the code to ensure that the fd is not closed
	twice (as would happen when destructing the fdbuf).

1999-05-31  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdobuf.cc: Redefined flush as nflush; added sync code to nflush;
	made flush and sync call nflush; added mutex lock calls to all
	public methods.

	* fdibuf.cc: Added mutex lock calls to all public methods.

	* fdbuf.cc: Added debugging implementations of lock() and unlock()
	mutex operators (to be removed before real use).

1999-05-28  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdobuf.cc (fdobuf): Fixed missing initialization of bufpos in
	one of the two constructors.

1999-05-01  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdobuf.cc (fdobuf): Added an optional "mode" parameter which
	defaults to 0666, which is the permissions for the new file.
	(sync): Wrote this function to fsync the file descriptor.

1999-04-27  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdbuf.h (fdobuf): Removed definition for sync and nonblock mode,
	as they won't be handled correctly in the writing code.

1999-04-03  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdobuf.cc (operator<<): Wrote an operator for signed and
	unsigned longs, with overloaded functions for ints and shorts that
	promote the parameters to longs.
	(write): Wrote a write routine specifically for a single
	character.

1999-04-01  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdobuf.cc: Fixed handling of seek by adding a "bufpos" indicator
	that points to the current position in the buffer at which writes
	should go.  buflength is effectively the maximum value of bufpos
	between flushes.

	* fdibuf.cc (get): Renamed getchar to get (to be potentially
	overloaded with other types).

	* fdbuf.h (fdbuf): Removed a bunch of write methods and replaced
	them with "operator<<", with similar capability to iostreams
	methods of the same names.

	* fdobuf.cc (endl): Wrote this manipulator to write an end-of-line
	and flush the buffer.

1999-03-31  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* fdobuf_mystring.cc: Moved all the mystring-specific code from
	fdobuf.cc into this module to lessen link problems.

	* fdibuf_mystring.cc: Moved all the mystring-specific code from
	fdibuf.cc into this module to lessen link problems.

	* fdobuf.cc (seek): Wrote this seek routine to allow movement in
	an output file buffer.

	* fdibuf.cc (seek): Generalized the rewind routine to allow
	arbitrary seeks.  It also checks to see if the seek point is
	within the current buffer and if so just repositions its
	pointers.

	* fdbuf.h: If BUFSIZE is not defined, set it here to 4096.
	(class fdbuf ): Rename length, start, and size to buflength,
	bufstart, and bufsize.  Add a new field "offset" to indicate the
	current file seek offset.
