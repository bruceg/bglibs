<h1>cvm-sasl</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>cvm-sasl is a library for programs that need to do authentication
via SASL (RFC 2222).  It provides a generic interface for doing the
authentication using CV modules.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>To configuration an application that uses cvm-sasl, set one or more
of the following environment variables to the name of a CVM that can
accept the indicated type of credentials: <table border=1>

<tr> <th>Name</th> <th>SASL Mechanism</th> <th>CVM Credentials</th>
</tr>

<tr> <td>CVM_SASL_CRAM_MD5</td> <td>CRAM-MD5 (RFC 2195)</td> <td>2:
Challenge, Response</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>CVM_SASL_LOGIN</td> <td>LOGIN</td> <td>1: Plain text
password</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>CVM_SASL_PLAIN</td> <td>PLAIN (RFC 2595)</td> <td>1: Plain
text password</td> </tr>

</table>

Note: as of this writing, there are no CRAM-MD5 CVMs, so that
functionality is completely untested.</p>
